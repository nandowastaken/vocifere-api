# Vocifere API (in development)

Vocifere is an open-source dictionary api that returns the pronunciation and meaning of a word, as well with it's translation for other languages.

### Future requests

Obviously you make requests for an API, the only request I have thought of building for this is...

GET - 200 OK
Parameters: language of the word, word, language of the meaning (if not provided, returns the meaning in the language of the word)
Returns: id, word, pronunciation, meaning
